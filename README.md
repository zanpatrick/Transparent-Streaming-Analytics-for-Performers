# 📊 Transparent Streaming Analytics for Performers

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform that brings transparency to streaming analytics! This project empowers performers (like musicians, podcasters, and live streamers) to track streams, views, and earnings in a verifiable, tamper-proof way using the Stacks blockchain. No more opaque black-box algorithms from centralized platforms—everything is on-chain for trust and accountability.

## ✨ Features

📈 Real-time stream logging with immutable records  
🔍 Verifiable analytics dashboards for plays, demographics, and engagement  
💰 Automated royalty calculations and distributions  
🛡️ Dispute resolution mechanism for contested data  
👥 Performer and listener registration with identity verification  
📅 Time-based reporting for historical insights  
🗳️ Governance voting for platform updates  
🔗 Integration with oracles for off-chain data validation  
🚫 Anti-fraud measures to prevent fake streams  
📝 Metadata storage for content details  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project is built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It involves 8 interconnected contracts for modularity and security:  
- **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles registration of performers and listeners.  
- **StreamLogger.clar**: Logs individual stream events with timestamps and user data.  
- **AnalyticsAggregator.clar**: Aggregates logs into meaningful stats like total plays and regional breakdowns.  
- **RoyaltyCalculator.clar**: Computes earnings based on predefined formulas and aggregated data.  
- **PaymentDistributor.clar**: Automates token or STX transfers for royalties.  
- **DisputeResolver.clar**: Allows challenges to data with on-chain voting or oracle checks.  
- **GovernanceToken.clar**: Manages a DAO token for community governance.  
- **MetadataStorage.clar**: Stores content hashes, titles, and descriptions securely.  

**For Performers**  

- Register your profile via UserRegistry with your wallet address and content metadata.  
- Upload content details (e.g., song hash, title) to MetadataStorage.  
- As streams occur, platforms or apps submit events to StreamLogger (verified via oracles).  
- Query AnalyticsAggregator for transparent reports on your performance.  
- Trigger RoyaltyCalculator to compute and PaymentDistributor to claim earnings.  
- If disputes arise, use DisputeResolver to challenge and resolve.  

**For Listeners and Verifiers**  

- Register optionally via UserRegistry for verified interactions.  
- View public analytics through AnalyticsAggregator for any performer.  
- Participate in governance votes using GovernanceToken to influence platform rules.  
- Verify stream integrity by checking immutable logs in StreamLogger.  

That's it! Build trust in streaming with blockchain-powered transparency.
